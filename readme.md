# INTRODUCTION

This repo contains solutions to various programming problems available online, most of them coded in `C++`.
It also has a few template files related to specific algorithms or data structure.

Each solution file is appended with a `commented` section on top. It consists of:
- [Tags](https://github.com/kaushal02/CP#tags)
- Problem description and/or link
- Runtime complexity

## TAGS

Every solution file starts with one or more tags representing the algorithm/data structure used to solve the problem. Follow the link to the tags to discover related problems in the repo.
